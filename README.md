# 📝 File Read & Write Challenge with Error Handling

This Python program demonstrates basic file handling skills including reading from a file, modifying its content, writing to a new file, and gracefully handling errors such as missing or unreadable files.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Reads content from a user-specified file
- 🧠 Modifies the file content (currently converts to UPPERCASE)
- 💾 Writes the modified content to a new file (`modified_<original_filename>`)
- 🛡️ Handles errors (e.g., file not found, read/write issues)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your machine

### Running the Program

1. Save the script as `file_handler.py`.
2. Make sure you have a text file (e.g., `sample.txt`) in the same directory.
3. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python file_handler.py
